# ü¶úÔ∏èüîó LangChain ü§ù Amazon Web Services (AWS)

This repository provides LangChain components for various AWS services. It aims to replace and expand upon the existing LangChain AWS components found in the `langchain-community` package in the LangChain repository.

## Features

- **LLMs**: Includes LLM classes for AWS services like [Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock) and [SageMaker Endpoints](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/deploy/), allowing you to leverage their language models within LangChain.
- **Retrievers**: Supports retrievers for services like [Amazon Kendra](https://aws.amazon.com/kendra/) and [KnowledgeBases for Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/knowledge-bases/), enabling efficient retrieval of relevant information in your RAG applications.
- **Graphs**: Provides components for working with [AWS Neptune](https://aws.amazon.com/neptune/) graphs within LangChain.
- **Agents**: Includes Runnables to support [Amazon Bedrock Agents](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/), allowing you to leverage Bedrock Agents within LangChain and LangGraph.
- **More to come**: This repository will continue to expand and offer additional components for various AWS services as development progresses.

**Note**: This repository will replace all AWS integrations currently present in the `langchain-community` package. Users are encouraged to migrate to this repository as soon as possible.
