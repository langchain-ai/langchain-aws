    "# Bedrock AgentCore Memory Store Walkthrough - Long Term Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "This sample notebook walks through setup and usage of the Bedrock AgentCore Memory Store with LangGraph. This approach enables saving of conversations to the AgentCore memory API to be later extracted and retrieved, enabling long term memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup\n",
    "For this notebook you will need:\n",
    "1. An Amazon Web Services development account\n",
    "2. Bedrock Model Access (i.e. Claude 3.7 Sonnet)\n",
    "3. An AgentCore Memory Resource configured (see below section for details)\n",
    "4. Two strategies enabled for the Agent Core Memory resource, `/facts/{actor_id}` semantic search and `/preferences/{actor_id}` user preference search\n",
    "\n",
    "### AgentCore Memory Resource\n",
    "\n",
    "Either in the AWS developer portal or using the boto3 library you must create an [AgentCore Memory Resource](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/bedrock-agentcore-control/client/create_memory.html). For this notebook, only two strategies need to be enabled, user preferences and semantic memory. These strategies will automatically run once we save our conversational messages to AgentCore Memory and extract chunks of information that our agent can retrieve later. For more information on long term memory, see the docs here [AgentCore Long Term Memory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/long-term-memory.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the Memory enabled and in a `ACTIVE` state, take note of the `memoryId` and strategy namespaces, we will need them later."
