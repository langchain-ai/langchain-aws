    "# Bedrock AgentCore Memory Store Walkthrough - Long Term Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "This sample notebook walks through setup and usage of the Bedrock AgentCore Memory Store with LangGraph. This approach enables saving of conversations to the AgentCore memory API to be later extracted and retrieved, enabling long term memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup\n",
    "For this notebook you will need:\n",
    "1. An Amazon Web Services development account\n",
    "2. Bedrock Model Access (i.e. Claude 3.7 Sonnet)\n",
    "3. An AgentCore Memory Resource configured (see below section for details)\n",
    "4. Two strategies enabled for the Agent Core Memory resource, `/facts/{actor_id}` semantic search and `/preferences/{actor_id}` user preference search\n",
    "\n",
    "### AgentCore Memory Resource\n",
    "\n",
    "Either in the AWS developer portal or using the boto3 library you must create an [AgentCore Memory Resource](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/bedrock-agentcore-control/client/create_memory.html). For this notebook, only two strategies need to be enabled, user preferences and semantic memory. These strategies will automatically run once we save our conversational messages to AgentCore Memory and extract chunks of information that our agent can retrieve later. For more information on long term memory, see the docs here [AgentCore Long Term Memory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/long-term-memory.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the Memory enabled and in a `ACTIVE` state, take note of the `memoryId` and strategy namespaces, we will need them later."

    "For this example, we will use the AgentCoreMemoryStore to save messages in the pre and post model hooks so that we capture both the HumanMessage objects and the AIMessage objects that occur during the conversation. The pre-model hook runs before the LLM invocation and the post-model hook runs after it to capture the response from the agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pre-model hook will also perform a semantic search using the user's latest message to add a few relevant results to the LLMs input so it can have context into the users past preferences. If needed, the LLM can also search itself using the semantic search tool.\n",
