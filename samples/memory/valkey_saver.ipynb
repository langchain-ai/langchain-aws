    "# 🤖 Persistent Memory Chatbot with Valkey Saver\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 **Demo Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to build an **intelligent chatbot with persistent memory** using:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **🧠 LangGraph** for conversation workflow management\n",
    "- **🗄️ ValkeySaver** for persistent state storage\n",
    "- **🤖 Amazon Bedrock Claude** for natural language processing\n",
    "- **🔄 Advanced Context Framing** to maintain conversation continuity\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✨ **Key Features Demonstrated:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Persistent Memory Across Sessions**: Conversations survive application restarts\n",
    "2. **Intelligent Summarization**: Long conversations are automatically summarized\n",
    "3. **Cross-Instance Memory**: New graph instances access previous conversations\n",
    "4. **Production-Ready Architecture**: Scalable, reliable memory management\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 **What Makes This Work:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Complete Conversation History**: LLM receives full context in each request\n",
    "- **Smart Context Framing**: Presents history as \"ongoing conversation\" not \"memory\"\n",
    "- **Valkey Persistence**: Reliable, fast state storage and retrieval\n",
    "- **Automatic State Management**: Seamless message accumulation and retrieval"

      "Great question, Alice! The parallel processing capability is indeed one of the most significant advantages of self-attention mechanisms over RNNs.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Sequential Nature of RNNs\n",
      "\n",
      "RNNs process sequences step-by-step:\n",
      "- Each token's computation depends on the hidden state from the previous token\n",
      "- This creates an inherently sequential dependency chain\n",
      "- Token at position t can only be processed after positions 1 through t-1\n",
      "- This sequential bottleneck prevents parallelization across the sequence dimension\n",
      "\n",
      "## Parallel Processing in Self-Attention\n",
      "\n",
      "Self-attention mechanisms in transformers operate differently:\n",
      "- All tokens in a sequence are processed simultaneously\n",
      "- Each token can directly attend to all other tokens in a single operation\n",
      "- The attention weights for each position are computed in parallel using matrix operations\n",
      "- No sequential dependencies between positions during computation\n",
      "\n",
      "## Technical Implementation Advantages\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Matrix Multiplication**: Self-attention is implemented as matrix multiplications which are highly optimized on modern GPUs/TPUs\n",
      "2. **Computation Complexity**: O(n²d) for self-attention vs. O(nd²) for RNNs (where n is sequence length, d is dimension)\n",
      "3. **Training Efficiency**: Parallel computation dramatically reduces training time for long sequences\n",
      "\n",
      "## Practical Impact\n",
      "\n",
      "This parallelization capability translates to:\n",
      "- Much faster training on modern hardware\n",
